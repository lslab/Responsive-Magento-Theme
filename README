*Responsive Magento Theme*
This is the start of a responsive theme for Magento, I'll be copying the entire base/default theme to customise each page to be responsive, and a little more responsible on the code usage.

The idea of this theme is to be a starting point, more of a boilerplate than a complete theme.

I'm open for suggestions for improvements where possible.


Features:
* HTML5 / CSS3 features (minimal on CSS3)
* Responsive - From 320 up to 1200px (I'm using em based media queries but these are the equivilant in pixels)
